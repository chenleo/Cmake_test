Example 2
==========

Automatic generation of document HTML, PDF and Latex files 
using doxygen

NOTES:
=======

Step 1) cmake . 
Step 2) make
Step 3) touch *.mod.proxy files
Step 4) make 
Step 5) make test
Step 6) make clean

!! To modify the Doxygen configuration edit the Doxygen.cmake file
!! when CMake runs this file is copied (with filtering) to ./Doxygen

!! Doxygen will generate HTML content for the source in all subdirs 
!! of this project. HTML is written to the "html" subdir. I suggest 
!! copying the entire subdir to your $HOME/public_html/<project_name>
!! so you can access the generated pages via 
!! "http://www.scs.fsu.edu/~<username>/<project_name>". Also, Latex
!! is written to "latex"; however, it is uncompiled. 
!! If you want to generate a PDF, cd into the "latex" dir
!! and run "make" (this will output refman.pdf). 


!! There is a bug in CMake which does not correctly compile 
!! fortran modules. If you run make the compiler will give an 
!! error about a missing <...>.mod.proxy file. This is a problem
!! in CMake and should be fixed in the next release. For the time 
!! being we can manually touch the proxy files required in the local 
!! directory and rerun make to complete compilation.
