Example 2
==========

Multi-project or multi-level builds with CMake

NOTES:
=======

Step 1) cmake . 
Step 2) make
Step 3) make clean

!! There is a bug in CMake which does not correctly compile 
!! a Java subdirectory. If you first call cmake and make in the master
!! directory then cd into java dir and rerun cmake and make, this builds
!! the temporary files required for the master directory to finish 
!! the master build. This is a major hassle, but at least you can do 
!! multi-level builds for C++ and Fortran with no problem.
