Example 2
==========

Building and linking to shared libraries, static libraries 
and fortran modules

NOTES:
=======

Step 1) cmake . 
Step 2) make
Step 3) touch *.mod.proxy files
Step 4) make 
Step 5) make test
Step 6) make clean

!! There is a bug in CMake which does not correctly compile 
!! fortran modules. If you run make the compiler will give an 
!! error about a missing <...>.mod.proxy file. This is a problem
!! in CMake and should be fixed in the next release. For the time 
!! being we can manually touch the proxy files required in the local 
!! directory and rerun make to complete compilation.
